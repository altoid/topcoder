4 gangster case

1 comes first
2 always dies
3 always lives
4 always dies
1 dies if 4 is before 3, which is true in half the cases where 1 comes first (i.e. 3 cases)

so for case 1 comes first, there are 3 cases with 1 survivor and 3 cases with 2
multiply by 4

12 cases with 1 survivor and 12 with 2

--------------------
6 gangster case

1 comes first - 120 cases
2 always dies
3 always lives
4 always dies
5 lives if 4 goes after 5, which is true in 60 cases
6 lives if 5 goes after 6, which is true in 30 of the previous 60 cases
1 lives if 6 dies, which happens in the other 30 cases
